We expect our program to look at test.txt and print out the lines that contain foobar.
But how do we get these two values?
The text after the name of the program is often called the “command-line arguments”,
or “command-line flags” (especially when they look like --this).
Internally, the operating system usually represents them as a list of
strings – roughly speaking, they get separated by spaces.
There are many ways to think about these arguments, and
how to parse them into something more easy to work with.
You will also need to tell the users of your program which arguments OftEn
they need to give and in which format they are expected.
